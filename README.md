[AD-2P Web Interface](https://zami77.github.io/AD2P_Web/)

## About
AD2P is the Automated Detection of the year 2038 Problem. The purpose is to have a CLI tool that can statically analyze source code (currently using Libclang) and detect any potential vulnerabilities related to the year 2038 problem. A web GUI and desktop application have also been developed.

If you are unfamiliar with the year 2038 problem, please check the [2038 wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). It involves 32-bit Unix systems having time integer overflow occur in the year 2038. For further details on my project implementation please check out the [AD-2P SDD wiki](https://github.com/Zami77/AD-2P/wiki/Software-Design-Documentation).
